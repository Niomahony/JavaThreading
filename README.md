This was a lab exercise which we had about an hour and 10 mins to complete. 

Write a program in any programming language of your choice to perform the following 

Parallel Summation:
Implement a program to compute the sum of a large array (or list) of numbers (100000 random numbers) in parallel using multithreading.

My code can take integer arrays of any size, sort and sum them using multithreading. It checks how many cores you have and assigns threads based on that. 

For a random input of 100,000 integers, it takes between 41-90ms (depending on the size of the numbers, amount of cores in your PC, clock speed etc.). Far from the most efficient possible, but as my first attempt at multithreading I am happy with it.
